# Interest Calculator

This project provides a Java-based application designed to calculate financial interests. It offers functionalities for both simple and compound interest calculations, making it a versatile tool for personal finance management, educational purposes, or financial analysis in a professional setting.

## Features

- **Simple Interest Calculation**: Calculate the interest earned on a principal amount over a specified time period, using a given interest rate.
- **Compound Interest Calculation**: Determine the interest accumulated on a principal amount, considering the compounding frequency over a given time period.
- **Method Overloading**: The simple interest calculation method is overloaded to offer flexibility, allowing for calculations with or without a default time period.

## Usage

1. **Simple Interest Calculation**
   - Calculate the simple interest by providing the principal amount, interest rate, and time period.
   - An overloaded method allows calculating simple interest for a default time period of 1 year, requiring only the principal amount and interest rate.

2. **Compound Interest Calculation**
   - Calculate the compound interest by specifying the principal amount, interest rate, time period, and compounding frequency.

The application is designed with ease of use and accessibility in mind, providing clear, unambiguous results for both simple and compound interest calculations.
